# Results


Guidelines for interpreting the updated maps:
- A marker follows the current location of the snowplow
- Roads that are deadheaded are drawn in bright red
- Roads that need another pass in the opposite direction are first drawn as dashed lines
- Roads that need multiple passes are drawn with a thinner line (with each subsequent pass, the line becomes thicker)
